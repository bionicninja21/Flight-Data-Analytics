# Flight-Data-Analytics
In this project, an Oozie based workflow is developed which is used to execute 3 mapreduce programs to analyze the flight data. The flight data analyzed can be downloaded from the link below: http://statcomputing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html Each mapreduce program solves one of the following problems: a. the 3 airlines with the highest and lowest probability, respectively, for being on schedule; b. the 3 airports with the longest and shortest average taxi time per flight (both in and out), respectively; c. the most common reason for flight cancellations
